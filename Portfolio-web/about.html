            <p>My name is Muhammad Ahmad Nadeem, Im from lahore (Pakistan). I started programming as my profession
                almost in 2022, When i was rejected by Pak army twice, when I completed my intermediate studies I
                started thinking that in which field should i get admission, and that was the days of the rise of AI
                specially the advent of Chat GPT, and after wasting a year on thinking the best option I took admission
                in PUCIT in BS-IT and it is expected to complete in 2027 inshallah !</p>

            <p>My main aim is to be proficient in full-stack development as well as in data science. To obtain my goal,
                I practice programming day and night. I have hands-on experience with Python, C++, and C. Additionally,
                I have learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, and Tailwind CSS. My efforts didn't end there; I also
                learned backend development, preferring Python over JavaScript. I have experience with Flask and Django.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bec1">
            <p>To keep growing, I shifted towards databases and learned about relational databases (SQL), including
                MySQL and PostgreSQL. In version control, I am proficient with Git and GitHub. This knowledge has been
                essential in my development journey, allowing me to manage and collaborate on projects effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bec1">
            <p>Today, I support students and my guild across the world on social media by answering questions about
                programming. This has led to forming a team dedicated to learning and growth. I am passionate about
                teaching people what I know, whether it's coding or any other lesson, and I enjoy helping others achieve
                their goals.</p>

        <p>Working together on various projects has been incredibly impactful. For example, during
            a challenging period in my life, I faced numerous setbacks, including struggling with academic pressure and
            personal issues. Despite these challenges, I managed to bounce back by dedicating myself to enhancing my
            technical skills. I successfully completed several key projects and coursework, which helped me regain
            confidence and stability. Through continuous learning and perseverance, I emerged stronger and more
            proficient in my craft.</p>

            <P>My drive for personal and professional growth led me to immerse myself in various
                programming tutorials, online courses, and hackathons. I attended tech seminars and workshops, learned
                multiple programming languages, and eventually pursued many certificates.

                It's common for students to feel lost or uncertain about their career path. You might struggle to find
                direction or feel unsatisfied with your academic progress. I've been there, and I understand how
                challenging it can be. I'm here to share my experiences and help you navigate through these obstacles,
                making your journey in tech much smoother and more fulfilling!</P>
